CEIS110 is Intro to programming

There are three files here. 
the first one "Turned-in-Final.py" is the actual class final that was turned in
the second one "Enhanced-Final.py" is what I turned the class final into. There is a huge difference between the two. 
The third "Calculator.py" This is one that I did while taking the class. It wasn't an assignment but I wanted to practice. To challenge myself I chose to write a calculator 
  that would take an entire expression and print out the step by step process of simplifying it. Ultimately concluding at the simplified answer. What makes this unique is the challenge I gave myself.
  do this without importing any libraries. That means the parsing, input verification had to be all done without the aid of regular expressions. It also means that the math had to be done without the aid of
  the math library. It sounds simple? I thought so to, until one gets into just how deep the rabit hole goes with brackets(){}[] taht may not match or may be unbalanced, Expressions that result in a complex number
  an in valid character in the expression such as a letter "a," and so on. Most of the code in this, is error checking, validation and parsing.
